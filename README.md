# GameTable

An open ended game table with network support.

This also provides some convenience features for Warhammer Quest (1995) style gameplay.
In future these game specific features will likely be moved into some kind of optional plugin.

## Origin
This is a diversion of Gametable - http://gametableproj.sourceforge.net

This project attempts to fix issues and enhance the original, seemingly dead project.
This project also adds convenience features for gameplay similar to the original Warhammer Quest.

## Plugins

A rudimentary plugin system exists to allow the base functionality to be expanded.

## Installing a plugin

To install a plugin, simply place the plugin's `.jar` file into the `plugins` directory.
The plugin will then be loaded the next time the application starts.

## Creating a plugin

To create a plugin, you need to generate a `.jar` file which has a file `/META-INF/services/com.galactanet.gametable.IGametablePlugin`.
This file should contain a single line, which contains the full class name of a class also included in the `.jar` file which implements the interface `com.galactanet.gametable.IGametablePlugin`.
The class which implements the interface should take no arguments to its constructor.
